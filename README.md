Sendy Logistics Challenge
Predicting Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for Motorbike Deliveries in Nairobi

Overview

The Sendy Logistics Challenge, hosted by Sendy in partnership with insight2impact facility (i2i), aimed to improve logistics efficiency by predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for motorbike deliveries in Nairobi. The challenge involved leveraging historical data to build a predictive model that estimates delivery times from pickup to the final destination.
Efficient and affordable logistics are crucial for economic growth. In Sub-Saharan Africa, logistics costs can increase the price of manufactured goods by up to 320%, compared to only 90% in Europe. By enhancing customer communication and optimizing order scheduling, Sendy aims to reduce costs and improve service reliability.

Problem Statement

Given the details of a Sendy order, the objective of this challenge was to develop a model that accurately predicts the arrival time of a delivery rider at the destination. The solution would:
Improve customer communication by providing accurate delivery estimates.
Enhance logistics efficiency, reducing business costs.
Optimize resource management and order scheduling for better planning.

Data and Features

The dataset included various features such as:
Order details: Pickup and delivery locations, timestamps, order status.
Rider information: Historical performance, past delivery times.
Traffic and distance: Road conditions, distance between pickup and delivery points.
External factors: Weather, time of day, congestion levels.

Solution Approach

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed data for model training.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Engineered new features to improve predictive performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed correlations between features and ETA.
Identified patterns in delays and delivery times.
Visualized key trends affecting ETA.
Model Development:
Trained various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
Evaluation and Deployment:
Validated model performance using a test dataset.
Compared predictions with actual delivery times.
Proposed deployment strategies for integrating the model into Sendy's platform.
Results and Impact
Improved ETA prediction accuracy, leading to better customer satisfaction.
Optimized rider scheduling, reducing idle time and improving efficiency.
Enhanced operational decision-making through data-driven insights.
